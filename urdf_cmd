urdf file example in rviz:

go to the directory that includes the urdf file

location: urdf/01-myfirst.urdf

run this command:

roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=urdf/01-myfirst.urdf

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

another example for (inmoov_ros-master) (robbie_description)

go to the "inmoov_ros-master/robbie_description" directory and run this command

roslaunch urdf_tutorial display.launch model:=urdf/rob_inmoov.urdf

note:
This command will run the robbie urdf file in rviz but it is missing some of the packages in "robbie_description"
As a result, some of the RobotModel will not appear in rviz "search and fix this error"

Possible fix: add the missing packages by redirecting the location to be read from
